\section{Measurement steps}

In this section, used measurement configurations are presented for each measurement 
task. Measurements in question may be divided into two distinct categories: power 
measurements with a spectrum analyzer (SA) and two-port transmission measurements ($S_{21}$)
with a vector network analyzer (VNA). There were no significant differences between 
the planned setups and those used in the actual measurements. The following measuremeent 
specific subsections will elaborate.


\subsection{1~dB compression point}

To measure 1~dB compression point of a device, one needs a (manually) sweepable signal source 
and power detector. These may come separately or be incorporated in a single device. 
In both cases, the DDU module is connected the in between the source and the detector.
We used both approaches, and made two measurements with equal power levels.

For separate signal generation and detection, we used \textit{Rohde \& Schwarz SML03} signal 
generator (SG) and \textit{HP 8596E} spectrum analyzer.The measurement setup is shown in Figures 
\ref{f:sg1} and \ref{f:sg2}. The setup employing \textit{Rohde \& Schwarz ZVL} VNA is shown in 
Figures \ref{f:vna1} and \ref{f:vna2}. All equipment came precalibrated.

\end{figure}

In essence, the measurement was a power sweep at a constant frequency of 
$f = 900$ MHz; mapping detected power or gain against used input power. 
This raw data was later postprocessed using Matlab.

We started with a source power of $-40$~dBm; a power level well below the 
1~dB compression point. The power was gradually used in steps of first 
10~dB, then 5~dB and finally 1~dB, until clear compression was observed. 
Compression may be seen in the lower than expected values of detected 
power (SG \& SA), or equivalently as lower gain (VNA).

Since we were measuring a GSM receiver, we used settings found in the GSM 
specification for the spectrum analyzer with the expeception of smaller 
averaging factor. They settings were as follows: an averaging factor of 100, 
zero span and 30~kHz video and resolution bandwidths. Input attenuation of the 
spectrum analyzer was increased from 10~dB all the way to 30~dB as we moved onto 
higher powers. 

The two cables and attenuators were measured separately using a VNA. For the VNA, 
the measurement settings throughout this lab were as follows: 1601 points over 
a frequency range of $800 \ldots 1000$~MHz, a measurement bandwidth of 10~kHz 
and averaging over 200 samples.

For more accurate and/or reliable SA measurements, even a larger attenuation factor 
could have been used to avoid the small, yet possible, compression in the SA. One 
chould have also not trusted the quality of the SG as much than we did. The whole 
power sweep should have also been recorded without the DDU-module in between.
Also, there was some oversigth in making the connections as can be seen in 
Fig.~\ref{f:vna2}. As its only an attenuator in a transmission measurement, 
there is most likely no great an impact on the results as such. Nevertheless, 
it begs to question connector repeatability.


\subsection{Frequency response}

The frequency response was already measured in the first labs using a VNA. Thus 
we didn't need to measure the gain in these labs, as we used the results from 
the first labs. While the measurement procedure was given in the final report of 
the first labs, it is repeated here for completeness.

The measurement was carried out using a \textit{Rohde \& Schwarz ZVL} VNA, 
calibrated by the assistant prior to our arrival. The calibration settings were 
as follows: full two-port calibration with 1577 points within the $850 \ldots 1000$ 
MHz band, $-20$ dBm reference power, and an averaging factor of 100. The reference 
plane was located at the non-VNA end of used the cables.

The actual measurement included connecting the VNA the port pairs in order to obtain 
the absolute values of $S_{12}$ parameter over a set frequency range. In terms of physical 
connections, this would mean the following: VNA (Port 2) $\rightarrow$ DDU modul $\rightarrow$ VNA (Port 1). 
The raw data was stored onto a USB-memory as \texttt{*.s1p} files for post processing 
using Matlab.


\subsection{Noise temperature}

ENR = 21.48 dB

In the third measurement task, we'll use a setup shown in Fig. \ref{f:m3}. 
A DC-voltage source is connected to a noise diode connected directly to the 
ANT-input in the pre-amplifier block. This direct connection is desirable as 
attenuation changes the noise temperature. The signal is led from the RX$_1$ 
output to a spectrum analyzer. An LNA may be needed in between the DDU output 
and the spectrum analyzer, as the spectrum analyzer might not be sensitive 
enough for the cold noise source.

	\vspace*{-12pt}
\end{figure}

The measurement itself is carried out measuring two power levels required in the 
Y-pa\-ram\-e\-ter; when the DC-voltage is off/shorted (``cold'') and on (``hot''). As 
for the SA settings, we are measuring noise at a single frequency (using zero-span): 
a very weak, random signal. Thus, input attenuator should be disabled, and minimum 
resolution bandwith used. A large averaging factor, say a thousand, is also beneficial. 
The measurement may take a few minutes, and it's OK; there are only two measurements 
to be made.

	\label{f:nd}
	\end{center}
	\vspace*{-12pt}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Sensitivity}

In the sensitivity measurement, we're trying to measure the minimum input power at 
ANT input that results in a detectable signal above the noise floor in the ouput 
of the DDU module. For this, a measurement setup identical to the one used in the 
first task may be used, as is shown in the following figure (Fig \ref{f:m4}). This 
time though it's more than likely that an attenuator is required.

\begin{figure}[h!]
	\begin{center}
	\setlength{\unitlength}{1mm}
	\begin{picture}(142, 13)
		\linethickness{0.2mm}
		\put(0, 0.4){\framebox[34mm]{Signal generator}}

		\put(54, 0.4){\framebox[28mm]{$\mathrm{ANT} \rightarrow \mathrm{RX}_1$}}
		\put(82, 1.4){\vector(1,0){20}}
		\put(102, 0.4){\framebox[40mm]{Sprectrum analyzer}}
		\put(68, 7){\makebox(0,0){DDU module}}
	\end{picture}
	\vspace*{\halfLine}
	\caption{Measurement setup used in the sensitivity measurement.}
	\label{f:m4}
	\end{center}
	\vspace*{-12pt}
\end{figure}

The measurement starts by measuring the noise floor at 900~MHz without any signal 
we're hoping to detect. That is, the RF power is switched off at the generator. 
Then we turn on an input signal that's some dBs sensitivity of $-112.5$~dBm. We 
gradually increase the power until the signal-to-noise ratio is no less than the 
10~dB required by the standard. One could also measure the power required to beat 
the noise just barely, and add the SNR later on if  $P_\mathrm{out}(P_\mathrm{in})$ 
relation is assumed to be ideal.

Since it's a GSM system, we use the measurement settings as they are defined in 
the standard. They are as follows: an averaging factor of 500, zero span and 30~Hz 
video and resolution bandwidths. As the spectrum analyzer input power is expected 
to be less than $-80$~dBm ($P_\mathrm{SA} \approx P_\mathrm{DDU,\;min} + G_\mathrm{DDU} = -112.5 \mathrm{\;dBm} + 24.4 \mathrm{\;dB}= -88.1 \mathrm{\;dBm}$), 
it's best to disable the input attenuator.

\end{figure}


\subsection{Frequency response}

Wasn't this already covered in the first laboratory assignment as a part of the 
diplexer characterization? Fig. \ref{f:m2} presents the measurement setup used 
there. The DDU module is simply connected between the two ports of a precalibrated 
VNA; ANT and RX$_1$ connectors of the DDU module are connected to ports 1 and 2 of 
the VNA, respectively. In the VNA, measurement power shoud be as high as possible 
due the stop band-attenuation, yet simultaneously small enough not to cause 
compression in the pass-band (in neither the VNA nor in the pre-amp itself).

	\caption{Measurement setup used when determining the gain of the pre-amplifier block.}
	\label{f:m2}
	\end{center}
	\vspace*{-12pt}
\end{figure}

The following figure (Fig. \ref{f:r1}) shows the results obtained in the first lab works 
with a transmit power of $-20$ dBm in the VNA (using the B-half of the BS and connecting 
the ports vice versa). In the figure, in addition to GSM RX and TX bands (in red), both 
3~dB (in blue) and noise (in green) bandwidth of the pre-amp block are visualized. This 
noise bandwidth visualization is somewhat questionable as it's a purely theoretical concept, 
but is nevertheless shown for scale. The shown noise bandwidth is found using a numerical 
approximation with $|S_{12}|$ of the formula given in the lecture supplement handout:

\begin{equation}
B_\mathrm{n} = \frac{1}{G_\mathrm{T,\;max}} \int_0^\infty G_\mathrm{T}(f) \, df.
\end{equation}

The noise bandwidth shown is less than the actual band since we cannot use infinite frequency 
range. Frequency range of $850 \ldots 1000$~MHz with $|S_{12}|_\mathrm{max} = 24.4$~dB 
was used instead. The obtained value (38.1~MHz) is roughly 6~\% shy of the 3~dB bandwidth 
(40.6~MHz), as one might expect. The 3~dB bandwidth may thus be used to avoid being 
overly optimistic.

\begin{figure}[h!]
	\begin{center}
	\epsfig{file=img/s12.eps, width=\textwidth}
	\caption{Results from the diplexer characterization.}
	\label{f:r1}
	\end{center}
	\vspace*{-12pt}
\end{figure}

In the graphical approximation method we need to investigate the effect of frequency 
roll-off speed. From Fig. \ref{f:r1} the transition bands are approx. 30~MHz (3.4 \%) 
and 5~MHz (0.55 \%) for lower and upper bands, respectively. During this transition, 
the $S_12$ drops roughly 100~dB from $+20$~dB to $-80$~dB. This corresponds to a slope 
of $3.3$~dB/MHz (29~dB/\%) and $-20$~dB/MHz ($-180$~dB/\%), respectively. The effect of 
such steep slopes are neglectable, and thus the 3~dB bandwidth may be used as the noise 
bandwidth.

\section{Error estimates}

TODO: Huy and Sampo (make additions, corrections, change the style to avoid excess 
repetition etc.)

In this section, error estimates for the two types of measurements are presented.
The values presented here are only rough estimates based on literature (with more 
or less general cases) and their soundness in this case is somewhat questionable. 
In this section, we do not take human errors (see previous section) into account. 
It is just stated that systematic errors arising from the cables and connections 
are possible in measurement all measurements. Thus they are valid only for 
``correct'' measurements, and are more of the ``provided for completeness'' 
nature. Probabilities are not given due to the nature/basis of the estimation.


\subsection{Spectrum analyzer}

Each of the components inside the spectrum analyzer contributes to the total uncertainty, 
depending for example on the signal frequencies, amplitudes, and measurement settings. 
The Agilent (former HP, manufacturer of the used SA) has made available a document that 
specifies the different error sources, giving also rough estimates for some spectrum 
analyzers. According to the document \cite{sa}, the error estimates vary broadly among 
different analyzer models, giving worst case uncertainties exceeding $\pm 6$ dB. On the 
other hand, the document gives also representative values of amplitude uncertainties, 
which in our case yields about $\pm 1$ dB.

The second error source for the spectrum analyzer is the power marker reading. In 
each of the tasks, the spectrum analyzer was set to average 500 measurement points, 
which should average out most of the random errors. However, reading the power marker 
in the screen, there was a noticeable fluctuation in the shown power value. Based on the 
experience obtained during the measurements, the power marker error is estimated to be 
approximately $\pm 0.5$ dB.

In conclusion, the error estimates that can be taken into account numerically are 
the manufacturers representative value of approx. $\pm 1$ dB, and the power marker 
fluctuation of roughly $\pm 0.5$ dB. These uncorrelated errors may be summed to 
achieve the total uncertainty of the SA measurements of approx. $\pm 1.5$ dB. 

There is also the question of calibrating the spectrum analyzer properly with 
the time interval defined by the manufacturer. Agilent suggests to have the spectrum 
analyzer calibrated thoroughly once in a year, and quick-calibrated if there are 
changes operating environment \cite{sa2}. If the spectrum analyzer used in the 
measurements is not calibrated correctly, it is possible that the measurements are 
not reliable. In this case, the calibration is the most important error source, and 
the device should be calibrated correctly before estimating any other errors.


\subsection{Vector network analyzer}

For the VNA, different error sources and ways to cope with them are listed in the 
lecture slides discussing VNA measurements. The different sources are noise, 
cabling/connector repeatability, directivity, isolation, mismatch and environment 
induced drift. 

Noise and cabling/connector repeatability are random errors, which can be averaged 
out. In our case, only the noise was averaged, since we did not touch the cabling. 
Systematic errors arising directivity, isolation, and mismatch in this task were
for the most part neglected with a calibration. Before conducting measurements, 
the VNA is always calibrated using a standard calibration module. The calibration 
moves the reference planes to the connectors of the test cables, and somewhat 
cancels the systematic errors from the connectors and cables used in a specific 
measurement. Finally, the environment induced drift is not relevant, since the 
measurement was done inside a short time interval.

Rohde \& Schwarz provides specifications that describe the measurement uncertainty 
of the VNA in question in different frequency bands. For transmission measurements 
in the frequency range of 50 MHz to 3 GHz, accuracy for signal powers of $-50 \ldots 0$ 
dB is better than $0.2$ dB ($0.3$ dB for powers of $-50 \ldots {-70}$ dB) with 0 dBm 
transmit power. \cite{vna} The reader should note that these ranges was exceeded 
from both ends during the measurements (the measurement power range was roughly 
$-100 \ldots {+4}$ dBm). 

In conclusion, two things are assumed. First, calibration is assumed to cancel the 
systematic errors arising from cables and connectors. Second, random errors are 
cancelled with averaging. The manufacturer provides error estimates for the device 
itself, giving an error estimate of under $0.3$ dB that is mostly applicable in 
our case. The topics discussed in the last paragraph of the last subsection apply 
here to some extent to here as well.
